**[A/B] BUTTON**: Press to switch the frequency display. This will determine which of the two displayed frequencies you’re transmitting and receiving on.

**[BAND] BUTTON**: Press to switch the band you’re operating on, which is wither VHF (136 mHz) or UHF (470 mHz). While the FM radio is activated, press to switch the FM radio bands (65-75MHZ or 76-108 MHZ).

**[SCAN] KEY**: Hold the button for two seconds to start scanning for active channels (channels that are transmitting). The radio will automatically stop at a frequency if it detects activity. While the FM radio is active, hold to search for radio stations.

**[#”KEY”] KEY**: Press while in Channel mode, press to switch between High and Low transmit power. Press and hold for two seconds to lock and unlock the keypad. This is useful for when the radio is on and you want to receive communications, but you want to store the radio without button-mashing any settings.

**[MENU] KEY**: Press to enter the main menu and to select and confirm settings (acts as “ENTER” key).

**ARROW KEYS**: Press and hold the UP or DOWN arrow keys to dial the frequency or programmed channels up or down while not in the menu. Use the arrows to navigate the menu, too.

**[EXIT] KEY**: Press to cancel a function or exit a menu or screen.

## Important Menu Options

###  0: SQL - Squelch Level
Squelch is the "cutoff" or "gate" for incoming transmissions, the higher the value the more distinct the transmission must be to come through.

Setting the squelch to 0 will open up the squelch entirely, setting it to 9 will close it almost entirely. 

### 1: STEP - Frequency Step
Selects the step in frequency step when using [UP] the [DOWN] keys. This is also the interval the scanner will run at.

### 2: TXP - Transmit Power
This controls how much power output your transmissions will use.

HIGH: 4-5w
LOW: 1-2W

Transmit power is only settable in Frequency(VFO) Mode. In Memory(MR) Mode transmit power will be set to the level programmed in memory for any given channel.

### 3: SAVE - Battery Save
Sampling ratio of the Receiver to acknowledge a signal. I think the higher value will sample more often (look for incoming transmissions) and use more battery.

### 5: WN - Wideband / Narrowband
In the USA, FCC part 90 radios are mandated to switch over to Narrowband communication by January 1st 2013. Meaning all commercial users. This does not affect Amateur Radio operators. If you don't know what this means you should probably be using Narrowband.

### 6: ABR - Display Illumination Time
Time-out for the LCD back-light in seconds.

### 7: TDR - Dual Watch
When enabled it allows you to monitor two frequencies simultaneously. It should be noted that this radio does not possess a dual VFO, meaning that the Dual Watch feature is a time sharing operation. Your radio will flip-flop between A and B channels at a fixed rate. This will not allow you to receive two frequencies in parallel.

NOTE: Be careful when using this setting because your radio will by default, transmit on whatever the active channel is!

### 8: BEEP - Keypad Beep
When enabled your radio will emit an audible tone at every key press.

### 14: VOICE - Voice Prompt
When enabled your radio will "talk back" to you, meaning audible confirmation when pressing keys and working the menu system. Can be set to Chinese, English or Off.

### 18: SC-REV - Scanner Resume Method
Sets the behavior of the scanner upon finding active frequencies.

• Time Operation: The scanner will resume after a pre set time. 
• Carrier Operation: The scanner will resume once the signal disappears. 
• Search Operation: The scanner holds on the frequency with detected activity

### 21: MDF-A - Channel Mode A Display
Sets the display mode for the upper display to either text or freq.

NOTE: Channel name can only be set via Computer.

### 22: MDF-B - Channel Mode B Display
Sets the display mode for the lower display to either text or freq.

NOTE: Channel name can only be set via Computer.

### 23: BCL - Busy Channel Lock-out
If enabled your radio will prevent you from transmitting on active frequencies.

NOTE: You should probably have this on!

### 32: AL-MOD - Alarm Mode
* SITE: Cycling tone over the air
* TONE: Radio speaker only
* CODE: Transmit 5s tone followed by Morse

NOTE: You should set this to TONE to avoid transmitting an alarm when that is not needed.

### 34: TDR-AB - Transmit selection while in Dual Watch mode
If enabled, this will force the radio to transmit on the selected frequency when in Dual Watch mode

## Reset/“Zero Out” The Radio
To setup the radio, ensure the battery pack is snapped to the back of the transceiver. Thread the antenna onto the antenna post and tighten. Turn the radio on by rotating the volume knob clockwise. It’ll click, the radio will beep twice, and then a voice will state “Frequency Mode” or “Channel Mode”.

* Press MENU.
* Use the up and down arrows on the keypad to navigate to menu option 40.
* Press MENU again to select “ALL”.
* Press MENU a third time to select “SOURCE?”.
* Press MENU a fourth time to reset the radio.
///////
* The radio will reset and default to a Chinese voice. To select your preferred language:
* Navigate to menu option 14.
* Press MENU again to select the language selection.
* Use the arrows to locate “ENG” for English (or your preferred language).
* Press MENU again to confirm the language selection.
* Exit.

## Use the UV-5R as an FM radio
The UV-5R’s most simple function is acting like an FM radio for your favorite stations. This is useful during disasters, when emergency broadcasts and information are put out through local radio stations. To enable FM mode, just press the orange “CALL” button on the size of the radio. Scan each station available by repeatedly pressing the */”SCAN” key.

## Enter, save, and use an emergency frequency
You can enter a frequency and start receiving and transmitting simply by typing the appropriate numbers on the keypad. For example, typing in 162.400 will key you into the NOAA weather broadcast. Typing in 151.940 will key you into the most common national emergency channel.

We want to program some emergency channels so we don’t have to remember all the digits to every frequency we might use. To save a frequency and make a new channel:

* Press VFO/MR to put the radio into Frequency (VFO) Mode.
* Press the A/B button to select the top frequency. Note the arrow to the left of the frequency on the display, indicating your selection. All programming must be done using the top frequency.
* Turn off TDR/Dual Standby (it should be off but confirm it is).
* Press MENU.
* Press 7.
* Press MENU to select the menu option.
* Use the up and down arrows to select “OFF”.
* Press Menu to confirm.
* Exit.
* Type in the frequency you want to save using the keypad.
* Press MENU.
* Navigate to option 27.
* Press MENU again to enter the channel selection.
* Select the desired channel (000 to 127) by pressing the up and down arrows. We recommend starting at channel 1, then 2, and so on. If a channel number has “CH-“ in front of it, that channel already has a frequency saved.
* Press MENU to save the frequency to the selected channel.
* Exit.

You can now select the saved frequency by pressing VFO/MR to select Channel Mode, and then pressing the up and down arrows. The radio will cycle through all the saved frequencies’ channels. While in Channel Mode, the display will show two of your saved frequencies, and the channel each frequency is saved on.

## Delete a saved frequency/channel

Deleting a frequency or channel is even easier:

* Press MENU.
* Navigate to option 28.
* Press MENU to enter channel selection.
* Select the channel/frequency you wish to delete.
* Press MENU again to delete it.
* Exit.

## Search for active frequencies and transmissions

You may find yourself in a disaster situation with no known frequencies or channels. If this happens, you can still use the UV-5R to pick up emergency communications by using it to scan the airwaves:

* Press VFO/MR and ensure the radio is in Frequency Mode.
* Press and hold the */”SCAN” Key.
* The radio will scan through frequencies rapidly, stopping when it hears a transmission.
* To set the number of frequencies the radio jumps with each scan, press MENU.
* Navigate to option 1: “STEP”.
* Press MENU to enter the step selection.
* Use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the amount of the step.
* The lowest step (2.5K) is the slowest and most thorough search. 50K is the fastest and least thorough frequency search.
* Change the radio’s operating band (VHF or UHF)

The Baofeng operates in two bands: Very High and Ultra High Frequency. Only one of two bands can be monitored and used at a time. To switch between bands:

* Press MENU.
* Navigate to option 33: BAND.
* Press MENU again to enter the band selection.
* Use the up and down arrows to select VHF or UHF.
* Press MENU again to confirm.
* Exit.

TIP: Many emergency radio frequencies, police, EMS, government agencies, and rescue operations use the VHF band.

## CTCSS and DCS (“private line” or PL communications)
Sometimes, one radio frequency will be used for transmitting and receiving by multiple operators. This is especially likely in a disaster scenario. Many first responders, command centers, and rescue operations will stick to one frequency to ensure stable communications. But in order to separate all the operators on a single frequency from each other (and to avoid sharing transmissions and crowding up the airwaves), two possible systems of tonal frequencies are used.

These tonal frequency systems are called CTCSS (Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System) and DCS (Digital Code Squelch). Both systems work largely the same, except DCS is digital.

CTCSS has 50 universal tones measured in hertz (67.0 Hz)
DCS has 105 universal tones measured alphanumerically (D023N)
To have a better understanding of this, consider a wireless phone and the cellular network it operates on. Think of the frequency itself as the network, and the CTCSS or DCS tone as the phone number. You must be on the network to transmit or receive, but you also have to “dial” the right number to communicate (the CTCSS or DCS).

There are universal, preprogrammed tones built into the UV-5R for both systems. You must know which tone the frequency in question is using, in order to transmit.

**How to Program CTCSS and DCS to a Frequency/Channel**

To program a CTCSS or DCS tone into a frequency that requires it (and save it to a channel):
* Press VFO/MR and put the radio in Channel Mode.
* Ensure you’re on Channel A by pressing A/B.
* Type in the frequency you want to save.
* Press MENU.
* Navigate to option 10 and 12 to set a transmitting and receiving DCS tone.
* Navigate to option 11 and 13 select a transmitting and receiving CTCS tone.
* Press MENU again to select the appropriate option.
* Use the up and down arrow keys to select the appropriate DCS or CTCS transmitting and receiving tones. In options 10 and 12, or 11 and 13.
* Press MENU to confirm your selection for each.
* Navigate to option 27 to store the frequency and the transmitting and receiving DCS or CTCS tones to a channel.
* Exit.

Now, the frequency you just saved should be on the display with either “DCS” or “CT” to the left.

## How to Program a Repeater Frequency

HAM radios can only travel certain distances directly, usually a few miles. Repeaters act like “waypoints” for a transmission, hopping it from one repeater to next, extending your communication range. This is incredibly useful in a disaster situation because it allows you to reach much greater distances. Some repeaters allow transmissions to reach thousands of miles.

To program a repeater and transmit on its frequency, you’ll need to know some information about the repeater itself:
* Repeater frequency
* Shift (+ or -)
* Offset
* R-CTCS or R-DCS (rarely)
* T-CTCS or T-DCS

Some repeaters use different tonal frequency systems that are not CTCS or DCS, or none at all. Those other systems cannot be programmed into the UV-5R. They are not covered in this guide.

**To program a repeater:**
* Press VFO/MR and put the radio in Channel Mode.
* Ensure you’re on Channel A by pressing A/B.
* Type in the frequency for the repeater you want to save.
* Press MENU.
* Navigate to option 10 or 11 to input the R-DCS or R-CTCS (if applicable).
* Navigate to option 12 to 13 to input the T-CTCS or T-DCS.
* Navigate to option 25: SFT-D.
* Set the positive or negative shift for the CTCS/DCS (provided).
* Navigate to option 26: Offset.
* Set the appropriate offset (provided based on band).
* Navigate to option 27 and save your repeater to a channel.
* Exit.

Now, in Channel mode, you can select the repeater channel and transmit on the repeater in question.

# Family Radio Service (FRS)

## About
(Source: [https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/family-radio-service-frs](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/family-radio-service-frs))
The Family Radio Service (FRS) is a private, two-way, short-distance voice and data communications service for facilitating family and group activities. The most common use for FRS channels is short-distance, two-way voice communications using small hand-held radios that are similar to walkie-talkies.

Other services that allow similar communications include the  [General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)](https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs)  and the  [Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS)](https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/multi-use-radio-service-murs-0).

The FRS is authorized 22 channels in the 462 MHz and 467 MHz range, all of which are shared with GMRS.

## Licensing
FRS is licensed by rule. This means an individual license is not required to operate an FRS radio provided you comply with the rules. You may operate an FRS radio regardless of your age, and for personal or for business use if you are not a representative of a foreign government.

## Operating a Family Radio Service (FRS) Unit

You can operate a FRS transmitter at any place where the FCC regulates radio communications, subject to certain limitations. A FRS transmitter may not be modified and must be certified by the FCC.

None of the FRS channels are assigned for the exclusive use of any user. You must cooperate in the selection and use of the channels in order to make the most effective use of them and to reduce the possibility of interference.

The usual range of an FRS device on channels 8-14 is less than one-half mile, but longer range communications can be achieve on channels 1-7 and 15-22 depending on conditions. You may not interconnect FRS transmitters and radios with the telephone system.

## GMRS FRS Dual-service radios

Some manufacturers received approval to market radios that were certified under both FRS and GMRS, which allowed users to use one device to operate on FRS channels, which does not require a license, and GMRS, which requires an FCC license. In 2017, the FCC changed its rules to stop equipment authorization of FRS dual-service radios and it changed the rules for both FRS and GMRS such that existing radios would be reclassified as either FRS or GMRS to remove the confusion of whether a license was needed for legal operation.

Specifically, if you have a radio that was sold as a dual-service FRS/GMRS radio and it is limited to the channels and power limits provided under the “Data” tab on this page, then that device can be operated as an FRS device without a licensing requirement. However, if the device exceeds the limits under the “Data” tab or includes any of the following channels (467.5500, 467.5750, 467.6000, 467.6250, 467.6500, 467.6750, 467.7000, and 467.7250 MHz), then it is a GMRS device and an individual FCC license is needed to operate the device other than on the channels and with the bandwidth and power limits shown under the “Data” tab.

## Channels
There are 22 FRS channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 12.5 kHz, but the power of each channel may vary as indicated below. All channels are shared with GMRS, so you may hear communications from licensed GMRS stations on these channels.

#  Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS)
(Source: [https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/multi-use-radio-service-murs](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/multi-use-radio-service-murs))
## About
The Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) uses channels in the 151 – 154 MHz spectrum range. The most common use of MURS channels is for short-distance, two-way communications using small, portable hand-held radios that function similar to walkie-talkies.

Similar services include  [General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)](https://www.fcc.gov/general/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs)  and  [Family Radio Service (FRS)](https://www.fcc.gov/general/family-radio-service-frs).

MURS is authorized five channels that were previously in the industrial/business radio service and were known as the “color dot” frequencies in Part 90 of the FCC rules.

## Licensing
MURS is licensed by rule. This means an individual license is not required for an entity to operate a MURS transmitter if it is not a representative of a foreign government and if it uses the transmitter in accordance with the MURS rules outlined in [47 C.F.R. Part 95 Subpart J](https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/rules-regulations-title-47). There is no age restriction regarding who may operate an MURS transmitter.

## Operations
You may operate a MURS transmitter at any location the FCC regulates radio communications, subject to certain restrictions. A MURS transmitter must be certified by the FCC.

None of the MURS channels are assigned for the exclusive use of any user. You must cooperate in the selection and use of the channels in order to make the most effective use of them and to reduce the possibility of interference.

No MURS transmitter shall, under any condition of modulation, transmit more than 2 watts transmitter power output.

The usual range of communications between MURS stations is less than a few miles; connecting a MURS radio to an external antenna can extend the range to ten miles or more. MURS stations are not allowed to be interconnected with the public switched telephone network. A station identification announcement is not required to be transmitted. Other restrictions on the use of MURS stations also apply.

# General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)
(Source: [https://www.fcc.gov/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs](https://www.fcc.gov/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs))
## About
The General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a licensed radio service that uses channels around 462 MHz and 467 MHz. The most common use of GMRS channels is for short-distance, two-way voice communications using hand-held radios, mobile radios and repeater systems. In 2017, the FCC expanded GMRS to also allow short data messaging applications including text messaging and GPS location information.

Services that provide functionality similar to GMRS include the Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS), the Family Radio Service (FRS) and the Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS).

The GMRS is available to an individual (one man or one woman) for short-distance two-way communications to facilitate the activities of licensees and their immediate family members. Each licensee manages a system consisting of one or more transmitting units (stations.) The rules for GMRS limit eligibility for new GMRS system licenses to individuals in order to make the service available to personal users. (Some previously licensed non-individual systems are allowed to continue using GMRS.)

In 2017, the FCC updated the GMRS by allotting additional interstitial channels in the 467 MHz band, increased the license term from 5 to 10 years, allowed transmission of limited data applications such as text messaging and GPS location information and made other updates to the GMRS rules to reflect modern application of the service.

## Licensing
An FCC license is required to operate GMRS system. Licenses are issued for a ten-year term and can be renewed between 90 days prior to the expiration date and up to the actual expiration date of the license. After a license expires, an individual must request a new GMRS license.

A GMRS system licensed to a non-individual prior to July 31, 1987 is also eligible for renewal, but the licensee may not make any major modification to the system.

You may apply for a GMRS license if you are 18 years or older and not a representative of a foreign government. If you receive a license, any family member, regardless of age, can operate GMRS stations and units within the licensed system.

The FCC service rules for the GMRS are located in  [47 C.F.R. Part 95 Subpart E](https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/rules-regulations-title-47). You can find information about GMRS licensing in the rules.

## Operations
You may operate a MURS transmitter at any location the FCC regulates radio communications, subject to certain restrictions. A MURS transmitter must be certified by the FCC.

None of the MURS channels are assigned for the exclusive use of any user. You must cooperate in the selection and use of the channels in order to make the most effective use of them and to reduce the possibility of interference.

No MURS transmitter shall, under any condition of modulation, transmit more than 2 watts transmitter power output.

The usual range of communications between MURS stations is less than a few miles; connecting a MURS radio to an external antenna can extend the range to ten miles or more. MURS stations are not allowed to be interconnected with the public switched telephone network. A station identification announcement is not required to be transmitted. Other restrictions on the use of MURS stations also apply.

## Channels
There are 30 GMRS channels with a bandwidth of 25 kHz (20 KHz authorized bandwidth) or 12.5 kHz as outlined below:

# NOAA Weather Broadcast Frequencies
(Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA_Weather_Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA_Weather_Radio))
**NOAA Weather Radio** (**NWR**; also known as **NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards**) is an automated 24-hour network of [VHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency "Very high frequency")  [FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation "Frequency modulation")  [weather radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radio "Weather radio") stations in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") (U.S.) that broadcast weather information directly from a nearby [National Weather Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service "National Weather Service") office. The routine programming cycle includes local or regional weather forecasts, synopsis, climate summaries, synopsis or zone/lake/coastal waters forecasts (when applicable). During severe conditions the cycle is shortened into: hazardous weather outlooks, short-term forecasts, special weather statements or tropical weather summaries (the first two aren't normally broadcast in most offices).

|CODE ONE                                                       |Informs all units to STANDBY - STOP TRANSMITTING. Do not transmit, except for emergency messages, while Code 1 is in effect. Dispatch shall announce, "Clear Code 1," when the condition is secured.|
|CODE TWO                                                       |Indicates an "urgent" call short of an "emergency" situation. A Code 2 call has priority over all other police activities except "emergencies". Proceed directly to Code 2 calls as quickly as is consistent with safety. Agents may, in exceptional cases, use their emergency equipment (both visual and audible to comply with state law) to traverse an otherwise clear intersection against a red traffic control device. Once clear of the intersection - turn off the emergency equipment.|

|CODE FIVE                                                      |Used when Wanted/Records checks are requested by an agent to alert the agent of a wanted felon, a person known to be dangerous or a person known to be mentally unstable. A backup unit shall be dispatched Code 2 on all Code 5's. Personnel will NOT proceed with Code 5 details until the receiving unit requests same. The unit receiving a Code 5 will request the details when he is in a safe position to do so, which might not be until his backup arrives.|
|CODE SIX                                                       |When an agent is dispatched to a traffic accident, and the dispatcher states, "Code 6," the agent will advise the drivers involved to proceed to the station to file their reports. This will only be done if there are no injuries, no unusual circumstance and the vehicles are safely operable. Driver Exchange Forms will be completed at the scene to include the C. R. number.|
|CODE SEVEN                                                     |Indicates "out of service - personal."                         |
